<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
"I want to build a mobile application... but where do I start?"
I've been finding myself asking this question lately so I've been reading up on Xamarin and MVVM. I came across this challenge a few days ago and it's the perfect opportunity to apply what I've been learning and get hands-on experience building with Xamarin.
I'm using the 10 Days of Xamarin challenge as a building block toward my goal of creating my own cross-platform mobile application.
